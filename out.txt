# Analyses
Each analysis result will be represented as a `Map [Label] (Map Label propertySpace)`.
That is, a map from call strings to a map from labels to properties.
Absent combinations of call strings and labels are unreachable.
Their properties are not restricted by the data flow equations and can be anything.
Assume them to be bottom for the least solution.
`Map`s will be printed as lists.
So the printed result will look as of type `[([Label], [(Label, propertySpace)])]`.
